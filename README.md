# Some Interpretation

- This is a Simple App. In this app, I just design Scaffold with text message to Check the Internet ```Connectivity Status```via
```Continuously-Checking``` and ```Not-Continuously-Checking``` and ```Socket-Method```.
- Also Message will be display with ```connected-network-type``` means: Either it is connected to Mobile network or WiFi network.

# Learning Concepts:

- initState method
- dispose method
- Flutter Toast package
- Connectivity package

# Working
